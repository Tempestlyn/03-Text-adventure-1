# 03-Text-adventure

main_simple.py contains the code we worked out in class (or a close approximation to it). It runs the zork.json file, as long as it is in the same directory. THIS WILL NOT RUN GAME.JSON

main.py is a little more complicated. 
It is set up to be able to run game.json, while still not breaking when running zork or dream.
There are lots of edits I would make if I had more time. I would definitely take the USE chunk of update and make it a seperate function.

While not specified in the game itself game.json's game is titled "Champion of Desquere".
